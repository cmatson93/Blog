## Amazons Leadership Principles

1. Customer Obsession

    - If there's any industry that teaches you how important it is to put the customer first it's robotics. During my time with SoftBank I have learned so much about making sure we always put customers first when building products. Most of my work done building WhizConnect was all done with the goal of helping drive adoption of our robots by bringing our end customers value through our products outside of just the physical hardware of the robot.
    - One specific example of contributing to customer needs was delivering a sms notification delivery service. As a product team we heard from our customers that the current pager given with the robot had a large ammount of short commings that made it hard for the end user to know when the robot needed assistance. We sought to understand these short comming and ultimately solve these short commings via sms notifications.
    - Specific areas we solved included not needing one pager per robot rather could just use their cell phone. Removed distance restrictions that the pager had when employees would move to other floors or buildings than where the robot was.

2. Ownership

    - Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job".
    - I love this one. I think having this kind of value is something that my previous roles could have had. Without ownership when things go wrong there's no one to step up and figure out a way to not make it happen again.
    - I've spent the last year owning all of our FE products at SoftBank Robotics. At times I've definitely failed in going for those short term results instead of the long-term value. 
    - Hubspot.

3. Invent and Simplify

    - Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
