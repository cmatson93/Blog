description: Some of my favorite movies, podcasts, book and TV shows of that I consumed this year. 
---

In a "normal" year a lot of my free time would be spent travelling or checking out new places around the Bay Area. While there has definitely still been some of that there has also been a lot more weekends and week nights spent at home just chilling. With all the extra time at home there has been many more opportunities to consume entertainment. So I thought I'd compile a list of some of my favorite books, podcasts, movies and tv shows from this year. Not all of them may have been released this year but I did watch, read or listen to them all this year. 



## **Movies**
Watching a good movie is one of Tommy and I's favorite things to do. In previous years that has often meant date nights out at the movies enjoying the benefits of Movie Pass and later the AMC membership. With that not being an option this year we upgraded our TV and added a few more streaming subscriptions to our list. 

In the early days of quarantine we made our way through a lot of the Oscar nominations from 2019 so a lot of these aren't new to this year but were enjoyed by us in 2020.

- **Little Women**

## **TV Shows** 
There really wasn't much better of an escape from reality this year than a good tv show binge and the streaming services sure didn't disappoint there.

## **Podcasts**
Podcast are something I would normally listen to on my commute to work or at the gym so didn't listen to as many as I would have liked to or did in previous years. But I did start the year off training for a half marathon and took a few road trips where I got some podcast binging time in and these are ones you don't want to miss! 

**The Other Latif from Radiolab**

If you enjoy some good investigative reporting similar to Serial style podcast this one is for you! Latif Nasser reporter for Radio Lab does a deep dive investigation into another person with the unique name Latif Nasser, Abdul Latif Nasser. Abdul Latif Nasser is a detainee at Guantanamo Bay who claims he was wrongly accused of terrorist acts resulting in his detainment in Guantanamo. This podcast is a detailed investigation trying to uncover if Abdul is actually innocent or not. Each episode will leave you feeling all the emotions and wanting more. 

**Staying in With Emily and Kumail**

This podcast not only got me through the early days of quarantine and Covid but also the final days of training for a half marathon that I wouldn't be able to actually run in. Emily and Kumail provide fun and entertaining commentary on how they were getting through the rough weeks of the Spring that was refreshing and relatable in so many ways. I was sad to see this podcast come to an end but holding out for another season soon! ðŸ¤ž

**Boom/Bust: The Rise and Fall of HQ Trivia**

Tommy and I binged this on a road trip back from San Diego this summer. This podcast is filled with captivating storytelling and just when you think you know what's going to happen next a curve ball comes and you are left wanting to start the next episode to find out what happens. For anyone who has worked for a startup or been around Silicon Valley types you'll even appreciate this podcast a bit more. 


**Daily Drive by Spotify**

Last but not least my daily podcast listen, Spotifys curated playlist filled with some good music and daily news podcasts. A great playlist to throw on when doing some light work and wanting to catch up on the days news. 


## **Books**
- **The Water Dancer** _Ta-Nehisi Coates_
- **Educated** _Tara Westover_
- **Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations** _Nicle Forsgren PhD, Jez Humble, Gene Kim_
- **User Experience** _Cliff Kuang_

## **Games**
Can't forget the games! Games are always a favorite of mine, whether it's bringing a group of people together, adding some friendly competition to a night at home or just unwinding by getting lost in a video game you can't go wrong! 

**Animal Crossing** 
Got to start off with a classic 2020 video game phenomenon, Animal Crossing. This game couldn't have had better timing this year, creating a way for people all over the world who were quarantined in their own houses to connect with others virtually. Hours spent creating and building our islands brought out just the right amount of child like fun we all needed this year. 

**Among Us** 
Following on the perfect video games for 2020 I have to mention the popular one of the second half of the year, Among Us. Some of my favorite virtual hangouts this year have been playing this game with colleagues, family and friends. I'm all here for any virtual game that can bring a group of people together for a night full of laughter. 

**Kubb** 
Another game perfect for the restrictions that we now have to navigate during a pandemic is a good socially distant yard game, Kubb. I actually played Kubb at a friends house awhile back and hadn't really thought of it much since but when Tommy and I bought a house with a yard I immediately thought of it. Our back yard in the summer and fall days has been such a blessing as we've been able to safely invite others over and hangout. Kubb provides a chill way to play something while also not being to intense that it kills conversation. 

**Hive** 
Tommy and I love board games and have slowly been collecting them over the years. We are always on the lookout for a good two player game and this year just brought more reason for that. Hive has been our go to! It's a game of tiles that each are a different insect which can move in different ways kind of similar to chess. Perfect game for a date night at home and is also really easy to bring with you on a picnic in the park or a day at the beach!
