# **Christina's Favorite Things of 2021**

## **Movies**

This year was spent watching plenty of movies from the comfort of our home just like 2020 but also reintroduced going to the movies, which I must say was a great feeling after being away from the theater for over a year!

The majority of those movies we saw in the theater were Marvel movies. Shang Shi, Black Widow, The Eternals and wrapping things up with Spiderman No Way Home each one was enjoyed for different reasons.

- **Coda** _(Apple TV)_
- **The Quiet Place 2**
- **Dune** _(HBO Max)_
- **King Richard** _(HBO Max)_
- **Dear Evan Hansenn**
- **Shang Shi**
- **Eternals**
- **Spiderman No Way Home**
- **Sound of Metal** _(Amazon Prime)_
- **Free Guy**

## **TV Shows**

We started the year off binging Bridgerton during our trip to Tahoe over New Years. This year was full of continuing to watch some of our favorite Apple TV shows from last year and introducing more with our new subscription to HBO Max.

- **The Morning Show Season 2** _(Apple TV)_
- **See Season 2** _(Apple TV)_
- **Mythic Quest** _(Apple TV)_
- **Ted Lasso** _(Apple TV)_
- **Bridgerton** _(Netflix)_
- **The Chair** _(Netflix)_
- **Squid Game** _(Netflix)_
- **Hacks** _(HBO MAX)_
- **Flight Attendant** _(HBO MAX)_

## **Podcasts**

2021 didn't really feel like much of the podcast year. Guess working from home puts a bit of a damper on that, or maybe just didn't find as many bingeable ones as in years past. But there were a few we enjoyed for sure.

- **ESPN Daily**
- **Washington Post Daily special on Game Stop To the Moon**

## **Books**

- **A Promised Land** _Barack Obama_
- **Dune** \_Frank Herbert\_\_
- **The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay** _Michael Chabon_

## **Games**

This years games are dominated with ones we were able to play as a family with our foster kids and Angela.

**It Takes Two** _PS5_
This definitely probably wins the top video game of the year. Mostly because it was one that Tommy, Xio and I all enjoyed together.

**Ghost of Tsushima** _PS5_
Another PS5 game that I dove into personally during some downtime between jobs this year.

**Throw Throw Burrito**

**SuperHot VR** _Oculus Quest_

**Mortal Kombat** _PS5_
This one probably is a second close number 1 to It Takes Two, would be curious so see which of the two we played more hours than the other. But I put it as second behind It Takes Two cause Tommy and Xio beat me 99% of the time haha.
