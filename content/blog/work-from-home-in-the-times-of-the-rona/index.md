## Working From Where? 

All over the world people are experinecing a new reality. For those fortunate enough to be able to have a job where they can work remotley that new reality is working from their home. This means navigating all the struggles and challenges that come with trying to spend hours doing work from a computer while sitting in the same room that you also lounge around in your sweats watching Netflix for hours. Not to mention all the other distractions that may be present in your home. For me it's sharing a work space with Tommy while we both have to take calls throughout the day and making sure our dog Leia is entertained enough so she doesn't feel too left out. Luckily for me as a software engineer my team already has a lot of practices and routines built in that help make working from home much easier. I also spent about a year working for a 100% remote team and through these different experiences feel I have some tips that may make this time easier, especially for those that don't normally work in a way that promotes remote collaboration. 

## 1. Set the mood

I've found that something that helps me the most is getting myself in a mindset that means it's time to work. For me this starts with waking up at the sametime I normally would when communting to work. I do the normal brush my teeth and fix my hair etc then change into some fresh clothes for the day. Now for me this does not include putting on jeans ðŸ˜‰, but it does mean putting on something fresh and making msyself Zoom presentable. This getting ready part of my day is supper important because it helps me wake up and start a new day fresh. 

Besides just getting "dressed" the next big thing to help get your mind ready to be in work mood is going to my work space. For me this is my desk, for Tommy it's the makeshift desk he's setup in the Kitchen. Whatever or wherever it might be for you, find a spot that is different then the same spot you will sit to "chill" later that night. This just helps create a seperation of work and home that is clear to your brain. 

## 2. Take Breaks

So you have now woke up, got dressed and placed your self in that spot to work. Now set some goals for the day. What is it you need to do by end of day to feel accomplished? What time do you have meetings or need to get on a call? Based off all those things when can you set aside sometime to take a break? Another big challenge when working from home is it is much more tempting to easily spend 30 minutes here and there on your phone or Facebook, you don't have colleuges or your boss walking by seeing your monitor. Making it easier to get side tracked or demotivated quickly. 

The most obvious time to take a break is lunch. This a time in the day where you would normally take a break so be sure not to miss it now. One thing my team has done that has been really great is set a 30 minute "lunch period" zoom session. Everyday from 12:30-1:00pm there's Zoom call and people can hop on while eating their lunches and just chat. Lunch is one of those times during the day that is really important to the social aspect of working it's often spent chatting with coworkers or going outside to get some fresh air. So whatever that normally is for you don't stop now that your at home find someway to do that even now! 

## 3. Find a time to stop

The last point I'll make around your daily schedule routines is finding a time to stop. Close the laptop and say to yourself that you are now "going home". Now if in point one your space was something like an office, great you can leave the room shut the door and not come back till tomorrow. For me it's just a desk in my living room so not quite the same bounry. But one thing I have found to help is everyday around 5:30 or so when I'm done for the day I either go for a quick run or do an at home workout. This means I change into my workout clothes go somewhere else and even get my mind off work. By the time I'm done and have showered I'm ready for dinner and work for the day is a distant memory haha. 

Just like all my other points this will also look different for all of you. What's important is just to find what works for you and how to
