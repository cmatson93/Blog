New Years Resolutions, career goals, dreams and all those childhood aspirations...
It always seems like they come and go so quick. Before you know it life comes at you and your time is spent cleaning the house, doing the laundry, paying bills and of course going to work so you can enjoy all those other things that you have to pay for. So who **_really_** has time to chase after all those dreams anyway? 

I've come to realize no one just has the time to chase their dreams. Rather they **MAKE** the time to chase their **DREAMS**.

At work today I was presented with some pretty cool posible opportunities for some career growth. I'm not sure if they will come to be anything that special or not. But what I am sure of is that if I just sit around and don't chase them nothing will come of it. So tonight I'm sitting down and starting the chase. It's past 11pm and on a typical night I'd be so ready for bed but spending an extra 30 minutes to grind out a few basic coding ideas starts tonight. 

>Step One: Get this blog looking decent.

Join me in this chase.
