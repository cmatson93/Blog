# Introduction to Data Sturctures

Structuring data so that we can better sort through things.

- A data structure is an easy way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently.

1. Mathematical and Logical Modals

    Just looking at an abstract view of them. Abstract Data Types. An example can be a List.
    - List is the abstract type.
    - An Array is an example of a concrete implementation.

**Abstract Data Types**:
Define data and operations, but no implementation.

## List as Abstract Data Type

- Store a given number of elements of a given data-type.
- Write/modify element at a position.
- Read element at a position.

An example of a list again can be an array.

What about a list that can do these things?

- Empty list has size 0.
- Can insert elements at any position.
- Remove
- Count
- Read/modify
- Able to specify the data-type of elements in the list.

Dynamic list of Integers?

```java
int A[max size]
int end = -1
```
